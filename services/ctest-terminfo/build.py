"""Reproducible build recipe for the `ctest-terminfo` SlateOS fixture.

Produces `ctest-terminfo.elf`, a native SlateOS (`x86_64-slateos`) binary
compiled from `main.c` by `zig cc` (clang + musl headers) and linked against
the posix `libc.a` sysroot with rust-lld. `scripts/create-ext4-rootfs.sh`
stages it at `/tests/ctest-terminfo.elf`; lane A's generic rung runs it with
`file` and asserts the exit code (42 == all checks passed), listed in
`services/ctest-generic.list`.

## What it is for

The image carries ncurses' whole terminfo database under
`/usr/share/terminfo`, compiled by the rootfs recipe: an entry per terminal
type, and a symbolic link for each of its other names -- the first symbolic
links on the image, some of them through `..`. This checks that the
terminals anything here is likely to be asked about are there and whole,
that a name reaches its entry through its link, and that the database is
all there. `main.c`'s header numbers the checks. It passes on Linux with
`TERMINFO_DIRS` naming a tree `tic -x` compiled from the same source.

## It cannot hang

Nothing in it waits, and `alarm(50)` ends the test whatever it is doing.

`-fno-builtin` keeps clang from folding anything into a precomputed answer
that never enters the sysroot.  Otherwise the compile flags mirror
`toolchain/x86_64-slateos.json` (static relocation, large code model).

## Build it through `ctest-fixtures.py`

    python scripts/ctest-fixtures.py build --only terminfo

which finds the fastpy checkout (whose `compiler` package this imports) and
rebuilds the sysroot first when `libc.a` is behind its inputs.
