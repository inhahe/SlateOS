--  x86-64 by exactly one constant -- see Duration_32_Bits below.           --
--  Everything else here is expressed via Standard'... attributes and so    --
--  was already target-neutral; the values GNAT derives for x86-64 were     --
--  checked against the compiler's own -gnatet dump (Pointer_Size 64,       --

--  This file IS the runtime.  A ZFP profile needs no adalib and no second  --

--  On the licence: the GCC Runtime Library Exception below is what permits --
--  linking this into SlateOS, because the compiling toolchain (FSF GNAT)   --
--  is an "Eligible Compilation Process".  design-decisions.md §201 held    --
--  that "GPL is not a problem here -- the toolchain is a tool we run, not  --
--  something we link; it does not reach our output."  That reasoning does  --
--  not cover this file, which does reach our output.  The Exception does.  --
