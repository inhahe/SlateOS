"""Reproducible build recipe for the `fastpy-truncate` SlateOS utility.

This produces `fastpy-truncate.elf`, a native SlateOS (`x86_64-slateos`) binary
compiled by fastpy (AOT Python -> LLVM IR -> native): a `truncate`-style
file-resize tool.  `truncate <size> <path>` parses a decimal byte count from
`<size>`, resizes `<path>` to exactly that many bytes, and exits with a code
encoding the result:

    exit 0 — os.truncate succeeded
    exit 3 — os.truncate failed (SYS_FS_TRUNCATE rejected / errored)

New ground vs. the `chmod` tool (which mutates *metadata* via
SYS_FS_SET_PERMS): this is the first fastpy tool to **resize a file's
content** — shrinking discards the tail, growing zero-fills.  The flow is:

  * `os.truncate(path, size)` -> new native runtime `fastpy_os_truncate` ->
    posix libc `truncate()` -> kernel `SYS_FS_TRUNCATE` (gated on
    `Rights::WRITE`) -> `Vfs::truncate(path, size)`, returning a bare int.

The size is parsed from argv with pure-mode decimal integer arithmetic (digit
`ord()` compares — the same pure-mode-safe helper shape used by fastpy-pkg's
`parse_int`), so the tool takes a human-facing decimal string like "8".

The kernel self-test independently re-reads the file's metadata via the VFS
and asserts `FileMeta::size` now equals the requested byte count, and that
reading the file back returns exactly the surviving prefix — a no-op truncate
that returned 0 without resizing could not satisfy this.

Pure-mode notes (verified bridge-free in the emitted IR — only the two
`fpy_cpython_import_native` sentinels from `import os` / `import sys`):
  * `os.truncate(...)` lowers to a native `fastpy_os_truncate` call returning a
    bare int (0/-1), used directly as a branch condition,
  * the decimal parse is pure integer arithmetic over `str`-indexed chars.

The kernel embeds the ELF via `include_bytes!` in `kernel/src/proc/spawn.rs`
and runs it as a ring-3 self-test (`self_test_fastpy_slateos_truncate`)
granting `READ|WRITE`.

Run with fastpy on PYTHONPATH so `compiler` is importable, from the root of
the worktree you are actually working in. There are four checkouts of this
repo, and naming one of them in a command is how a lane ends up building
another lane's artifact -- see `scripts/lib/worktree.sh`:

    PYTHONPATH="D:/visual studio projects/fastpy" \
        python services/fastpy-truncate/build.py

The posix sysroot (`libc.a`) must already be built; see
`toolchain/build-sysroot.ps1`.
