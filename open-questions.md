# Open Questions — Operator Decision Queue

Decisions that genuinely need the human operator: architectural forks,
user-visible policies, and tradeoffs with no obviously-correct answer that
Claude has **deferred** rather than resolved autonomously.

This file is distinct from:

- **`design-decisions.md`** — decisions already *made* (each marked with who
  decided it). When the operator answers a question here, move it there as a
  `Decided by: Operator` entry and delete it from this file.
- **`known-issues.md`** — bugs and accumulated technical debt.
- **`todo.txt`** — the working scratchpad / judgment-call log.

Format for each entry:

- **Question** — the decision to be made.
- **Options** — each with its pros and cons.
- **Claude's recommendation** — if there is a defensible default (and what
  Claude is doing in the meantime).
- **Where it bites** — files/symbols affected, so the resolution can be applied.
- **Status** — `OPEN` until the operator decides.

---

No open questions remain. All deferred operator decisions (Q1–Q6) have been
resolved — see the "Recently resolved" list below and `design-decisions.md` for
full rationale. New decisions that genuinely need the operator should be appended
below this line as `## Q7 …`.

Recently resolved (see `design-decisions.md` for the full rationale):

- The coreutils "which set is canonical?" question — resolved 2026-06-12;
  standalone per-tool crates are canonical (§8).
- Q1 `set_mempolicy_home_node` / NUMA mempolicy on UMA — resolved 2026-06-13,
  **operator-confirmed 2026-06-14**; keep the UMA no-op returning 0, option A
  (§10).
- Q2 `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` & memory-commit policy — resolved
  2026-06-13, **operator-confirmed 2026-06-14** (keep the shipped defaults:
  native strict/committed, Linux lazy/overcommit; both configurable); build the
  both-strategies model (Option 5); map the system-wide overcommit knob to a
  fine-grained native cap (`admin.memory_policy`), not `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` (§11).
- Q3 next major initiative — resolved 2026-06-13; terminal/dev before GUI,
  GCC/CMake/Make toolchain first, CPython then fastpy (§9).
- Q4 toolchain on Slate OS: run-prebuilt-Linux vs native-port — resolved
  2026-06-13; **Path Z** (run prebuilt Linux toolchain binaries on the Linux-ABI
  layer now, native-port selectively later), native-first/no-leak kept
  inviolate, clang green-lit for install (§12).
- Q5 file-backed `mmap` — how far to take the fix — resolved 2026-06-14
  (§22), then **REOPENED 2026-06-14** by the operator, then **RE-RESOLVED
  2026-06-14**: adopt **C-lite** (a unified *read-only* page cache for
  shared-library text dedup + de-double-caching), deferred until a concrete
  consumer appears (the dynamic linker is the likely first; stable VFS
  file-identity is the precursor); writable `MAP_SHARED` writeback stays declined
  / `ENOSYS` (§23). Deferral trigger logged in `todo.txt`.
- Q6 cross-process memory introspection — resolved 2026-06-14: keep
  channel/shared-memory IPC for *consensual* sharing; add a
  **debug-capability-gated** cross-address-space `process_vm_readv`/`writev`
  (`Rights::DEBUG` on a `Process` capability; `EPERM` without it). `ptrace`
  remains a deferred follow-up behind the same gate (§24).
