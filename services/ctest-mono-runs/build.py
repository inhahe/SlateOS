"""Reproducible build recipe for the `ctest-mono-runs` SlateOS fixture.

Produces `ctest-mono-runs.elf`, a native SlateOS (`x86_64-slateos`) binary
compiled from `main.c` by `zig cc` (clang + musl headers) and linked against
the posix `libc.a` sysroot with rust-lld. `scripts/create-ext4-rootfs.sh`
stages it at `/tests/ctest-mono-runs.elf`; running it at boot is the kernel's
side -- the generic rung asked for in
`requests/d-a-one-rung-for-every-c-fixture.md`, which runs each fixture
`services/ctest-generic.list` names. It goes on that list once it has passed
in a lane D boot, as the list's header requires.

WHAT IT IS FOR.  scripts/mono-spike/ links the Mono 6.14.1 runtime against
our libc.a with nothing missing, and the rootfs recipe stages it as /bin/mono
with mscorlib.dll at /lib/mono/4.5. This runs it: `mono --version`, then a
.NET program, `checks.cs` beside this file, compiled to checks.exe by
scripts/mono-spike/bcl.sh. Its eight checks run from a JIT-compiled Main
through faults turned into exceptions, a garbage collection, a second thread,
and C called by name. The legend of exit codes is at the top of `main.c`; 42
is both probes right.

`checks.cs` is not compiled here: compiling C# needs a Mono runtime, which
bcl.sh builds on the host, and it runs the program there first, so the lines
this fixture expects are the ones Linux's Mono prints.

Run with fastpy on PYTHONPATH so `compiler` is importable, from the root of
the worktree you are actually working in (`scripts/lib/worktree.sh` says why
naming another checkout in a command is how a lane builds another lane's
artifact):

    PYTHONPATH="D:/visual studio projects/fastpy" \\
        python services/ctest-mono-runs/build.py

The posix sysroot (`libc.a`) must already be built and current.
