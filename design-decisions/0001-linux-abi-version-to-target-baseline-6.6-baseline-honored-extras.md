## 1. Linux ABI version to target — baseline 6.6, "baseline + honored extras"

**Date:** 2026-06-06 (policy) / 2026-06-10 (uname surface resolved)

**Decided by:** Operator (Claude proposed the 6.6 baseline floor and surfaced
the forward-compat question; the operator resolved the forward-compat policy —
option (ii) "baseline + honored extras" — on 2026-06-10, per `todo.txt`).

**Context:**
The Linux compatibility layer (`kernel/src/syscall/linux.rs`) translates the
Linux syscall ABI for Linux binaries running on SlateOS. Linux's ABI is a
moving target across kernel versions; we need a single, defensible answer to
"which Linux are we?" so that feature detection, version gates, and
sibling-syscall consistency are coherent rather than ad hoc.

**Decision:**
- **Baseline floor: Linux 6.6.** We implement the 6.6 syscall ABI as the
  guaranteed floor. `uname(2)` reports `sysname = "Linux"` and
  `release = "6.6.0-slateos"`.
- **Policy: "baseline + honored extras."**
  1. Everything in the 6.6 ABI is the floor.
  2. **Never accept-without-honoring:** if we accept a flag/syscall, we must
     actually implement its semantics. We never silently ignore a flag we
     advertised support for.
  3. Post-6.6 features are kept **only if fully implemented**; otherwise the
     syscall returns `ENOSYS`/`EINVAL` honestly so glibc/musl can fall back.
  4. **Sibling-consistency ("Frankenkernel" trap):** within a feature family,
     don't implement some members and silently no-op others. Either the whole
     family behaves consistently or the unimplemented members return a clear
     error that the caller's fallback path expects.
- **ABI page size = 4096.** Userspace sees `sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) == 4096`
  even though native kernel frames are 16 KiB. Any byte→page count reported
  across the Linux ABI boundary (`mmap`/`mprotect`/`msync`/`mremap`,
  `/proc/<pid>/statm`) uses 4096, never the native `FRAME_SIZE` (16384).

**Rationale:**
- 6.6 is an LTS kernel — stable, widely targeted, well-documented ABI.
- `sysname/release` are **Linux-ABI-only surfaces**: in our architecture,
  native code uses native APIs, so the *only* callers of `uname(2)` are Linux
  binaries that expect Linux values. Reporting `"Linux"` / `"6.6.x"` is the
  faithful answer for that personality, not a lie about what the OS is.
- The release string MUST satisfy glibc's startup version gate
  (`__libc_start_main` → "FATAL: kernel too old" if leading MAJOR.MINOR is
  below glibc's build-time minimum). glibc parses only the leading integer
  triple, so `"6.6.0-slateos"` reads as the 6.6.0 baseline.

**Retained post-6.6 features (fully implemented):**
- `F_DUPFD_QUERY` (6.10).
- futex2 family: `futex_wake`/`futex_wait` (6.7), `futex_waitv` (5.16).

**Documented gap (sibling-consistency example):**
- `futex2_requeue` returns `ENOSYS` — glibc falls back to the legacy
  `futex(FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE)` path, so the gap is safe and honest.

**Alternatives considered:**
- *Pin to a single exact version with no extras* — rejected: needlessly drops
  cheap, fully-implemented post-6.6 conveniences that real binaries probe for.
- *Report "SlateOS"/"0.1.0-slateos" from uname* — rejected: breaks glibc's version
  gate and misleads Linux feature-detection that keys off the kernel version.

**Where it lives:**
- `kernel/src/syscall/linux.rs`: `sys_uname` (~line 31523), `const ABI_PAGE_SIZE: u64 = 4096` (~line 4534), byte→page reporting `bytes / 4096` (~line 4453).
- `roadmap-detailed.md` §72 "Version-surface policy".
- Self-test batch 526 pins `sysname == "Linux"` and `release` leading `"6.6"`.

**How to reverse:**
- Bumping the baseline: change the `release` string in `sys_uname` and update
  batch 526's assertion + §72. Audit feature gates that assume 6.6.
- Changing the extras policy: re-audit each retained post-6.6 feature against
  rule (3)/(4) before removing or adding.
