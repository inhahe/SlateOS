; Go's highlight query as tree-sitter-go 0.25.0 publishes it (highlights.scm,
; beside this file), with its general patterns -- the Identifiers block --
; moved from the middle to the top. Of one node's captures the last pattern's
; wins, in tree-sitter's own highlighter as in this one (design-decisions
; 1438); the published order, written when the first won, painted every
; function's name a variable and every method a property (1442). A test holds
