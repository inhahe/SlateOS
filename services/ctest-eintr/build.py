"""Reproducible build recipe for the `ctest-eintr` SlateOS fixture.

Produces `ctest-eintr.elf`, a native SlateOS (`x86_64-slateos`) binary
compiled from `main.c` by `zig cc` (clang + musl headers) and linked against
the posix `libc.a` sysroot with rust-lld.  `scripts/create-ext4-rootfs.sh`
stages it at `/tests/ctest-eintr.elf`; the kernel rung that runs it and
asserts the exit code (42 == all checks passed) is lane A's, requested in
`requests/d-a-run-the-ctest-eintr-fixture.md`.

## What it is for

`design-decisions.md` §1156 has a signal end a call that waits inside the C
library -- `sem_wait`, `mq_receive`, `msgrcv` and the rest -- as it does on
Linux, and `posix/src/interrupt.rs` replays glibc's answers on the host with
a stand-in for the kernel.  Only here does the kernel end a real futex wait
for a real signal and the trampoline leave the counts the wait reads.

## It cannot hang

Each wait is bounded from outside: the child that sends the signals kills
the waiting process three seconds after its last one unless it has been
killed first -- see `main.c`.  The worst case is a wrong exit code.

`-fno-builtin` keeps clang from folding anything into a precomputed answer
that never enters the sysroot.  Otherwise the compile flags mirror
`toolchain/x86_64-slateos.json` (static relocation, large code model).

## Build it through `ctest-fixtures.py`

    python scripts/ctest-fixtures.py build --only eintr

which finds the fastpy checkout (whose `compiler` package this imports) and
rebuilds the sysroot first when `libc.a` is behind its inputs -- which
matters here, since this fixture tests libc code changed in the same commit.
